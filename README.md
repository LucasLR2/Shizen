### Option 2: Run Locally

If you prefer to run Shizen on your own machine:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

That's it! Shizen runs entirely in your browser with no server required.

## 📖 Usage

### First Time Setup

1. Open Shizen in your browser
2. Choose one of two options:
   - **Create Account**: Set up a new profile with your name and photo
   - **Load Account**: Import an existing JSON data file

### Creating Your Profile

1. Enter your full name
2. Upload a profile picture and use the cropping tool to adjust it
3. Select which tools you want to enable (Accounts, Clipboard, Notes)
4. Click "Crear cuenta" - your data file will be automatically exported

### Managing Accounts

- Click **"Nueva cuenta"** to add new credentials
- Use the autocomplete feature to group accounts by category
- Categories show a badge with the count of accounts in that group
- Toggle accounts active/inactive using the power button
- Copy usernames and passwords with one click
- Add optional notes for additional context (2FA codes, security questions, etc.)
- Edit or delete accounts as needed

### Managing Clipboard

- **Automatic Detection**: Everything you copy is automatically captured and stored
- **Temporary History**: Up to 50 recent items stored during your session
- **Permanent Saved**: Save important items to keep them across sessions
- **Smart Type Detection**: Automatically identifies URLs, emails, code, numbers, and text
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between temporary and saved items with ease
- Copy any item back to your clipboard with one click
- Temporary items are cleared when you log out
- Only saved items are included in JSON exports

### Managing Notes

- Create quick text notes for reminders, ideas, and information
- Edit or delete notes at any time
- Notes automatically display relative timestamps (Today, Yesterday, etc.)

### Using the Timer

- **Quick Modes**: Pomodoro (25min), Short Break (5min), Long Break (15min)
- **Custom Timer**: Set your own minutes and seconds
- **Sound Notifications**: Choose from 6 different notification sounds (Bell, Beep, Chime, Ding, Digital, Soft)
- **System Alerts**: Receive browser notifications even when on other tabs (requires permission)
- **Visual Feedback**: Discord-style notification and page title flash when timer completes
- **Session Tracking**: Tracks completed sessions per day
- **Sound plays 3 times** when timer finishes to ensure you don't miss it
- All timer settings (sound type and mute state) are saved in your JSON exports

### Data Management

**Exporting Data:**
- Click your profile picture in the header → **"Exportar datos"**
- Save the JSON file in a secure location
- This file contains all your accounts, notes, and settings

**Loading Data:**
- From the welcome screen, choose "Cargar cuenta"
- Drag and drop your JSON file or click to browse
- Your profile and all data will be restored

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Important Security Notes

- Shizen stores data in browser sessionStorage during your session
- **Your passwords are stored in plain text in the JSON export files**
- This is a local-first tool designed for convenience, not enterprise-level security
- Never share your JSON export files with others
- Store your exports in a secure location (encrypted drive, password manager, etc.)

### Recommendations

- Use Shizen on your personal device only
- Consider encrypting your JSON exports with tools like GPG or 7-Zip
- For sensitive accounts, consider using a dedicated password manager
- Always export your data before closing your session
- Use the "Cerrar sesión" button to clear sessionStorage when done

### Privacy

- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- No internet connection required (except for loading fonts and icons)
- All data processing happens locally in your browser
- No accounts, no sign-ups, no servers

## 🎨 Customization

Shizen uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Edit the CSS files to customize:

**`css/shizen-styles.css` or `css/login-styles.css`:**
```css
:root {
    --accent-primary: #FF5252;      /* Main accent color */
    --accent-secondary: #81C784;    /* Secondary accent */
    --bg-primary: #121212;          /* Background color */
    /* ... and many more variables */
}
```

You can modify:
- Accent colors and gradients
- Background colors
- Spacing and typography
- Border radius and shadows
- Transitions and animations
